# DCGAN-Implementation-with-Data-Augmentation
In this assignment, we will build a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) capable of generating realistic images from a custom Pokeman dataset. After training, GAN will be deployed as a web-based platform where users can generate new images with a  button click.
